## Background
Non-additive effects resulting from the actions of multiple loci may influence trait variation in single-cross hybrids. In addition, complementation of allelic variation could be a valuable contributor to hybrid genetic variation, especially when crossing inbred lines with higher contents of copy gains. We aimed (1) to study the association between copy number variation (CNV) and hybrid phenotype, and (2) to compare the predictive ability (PA) of additive and additive–dominance genomic best linear unbiased prediction model when combined with the effects of CNV in two datasets of maize hybrids (USP and HELIX). We used 906 single-crosses of maize from an unbalanced diallel mating design between 49 tropical inbred lines (phenotypically characterized in 34 flint and 15 dent pools), contrasting for nitrogen use efficiency.
